Password Generator project

Code for index.html and style.css provided by https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/friendly-parakeet (Thank you!).
Starter javascript code provided by Farish Kashefinejad as part of early office hours for Wednesday, 10/18,2023.

Every single starter code line in script.js is (or at least should be) marked by: //instructor code

All additional code commentary added by the student in order to mark and understand current code, as well as making notations as to what is needed,
based on how the student interpreted the code.

As error-catching was not listed as a requirement, the student did not make provisions for what may happen if the user enters a letter or special character
instead of a number for the requested number of characters.

Function:

When the page loads, there is a dotted text box and a button listed as "Generate Password".  When the Generate Password button is pressed,
a number of popup windows appear in succession, asking if the user wants a password with uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and
numbers.  Finally, a popup requests that a user indicate how long of a password they want, between and including the values of 8 and 128.  The randomizer
then generates a password based on the selected criteria and displays it on the page.  Pressing the Generate Password button again will clear the current 
password and start the process all over again.
